# TherapistBotJS
This is my first attempt at a discord bot in JS! It is heavily inspired and influenced by the tutorial by FreeCodeCamp on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rU_KyudGBY). The bot has: motivational messages, a publicly updatable database of positive phrases and sad words to look out for and detects when negativity is used.
